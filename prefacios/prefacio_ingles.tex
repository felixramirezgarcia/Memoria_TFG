	The current dynamization of the real estate sector shows the need for a search for quality information through the different platforms that support this need.  
	The objective of this project is to provide a real estate information search service in Andalucia with a realistic and scalable business model, in which benefits are generated by subscription to the web application.
	In order to obtain the real estate information, it has been necessary to develop another application that is executed periodically to keep the database updated through requests to the API of the Nestoria platform.
	The information is visualised by making queries through territorial control panels on the web platform hosted by Heroku, a platform that consults a NoSQL database.
